The original Draco dataset was assembled manually and contains a subset of confirmed member stars. A second dataset was generated through the preprocessing pipeline as a validation test. A direct value-based comparison shows that the two datasets are nearly identical in sky position and line-of-sight velocity, with the test dataset containing approximately four additional stars that are consistent with the same population. No systematic shifts or distortions were found between the two. Because the test dataset is slightly more complete while remaining physically consistent with the original, it has been adopted as the primary Draco dataset and renamed accordingly. For traceability, an unmodified copy of the manually assembled dataset is preserved in the Original_Data directory, and a copy of the pipeline-generated dataset is preserved in the Test_Data directory.
