Methods Orbit super position modeling 


Translate the fortran equations 
change past to historical and move it to before methods 
change the title of 
Draco and Segue should be different chapters 


I could do a paper on draco and do that as my thesis 

Or 

I could expand on dark matter modeling exposing how much of the univse is black holes or x 


What if instead of the black holes at the center of a galaxy 

chapter after draco 

should be analysis 

chapter 7 we can start talking about pbhs axions and other lines of evidence as extra chapters
